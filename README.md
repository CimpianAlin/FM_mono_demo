# REDHAWK Basic Waveforms - FM Mono Demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK FM Mono Demo Waveform. This waveform processes the mono audio channel of broadcast FM Radio. 

## Build/Installation Instructions
This is a wavform project and thus does not need to be built just installed into the $SDRROOT/dom/waveforms directory. One way to do that is to open the project in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR Folder.
